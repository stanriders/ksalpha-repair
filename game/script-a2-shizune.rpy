    "Looking back on it, though, there never was that much work to be done, and both of the girls always did more than their fair share."

    "It depresses me that they know there's a problem and that I consequently have to acknowledge it, but I'm cheered up by their consideration."

    "There is no dodging the fact that they likely know that I'm not all well."

    "Maybe I'm just overthinking things."

    "I shift my thoughts towards what Shizune had said: That sign language is useful because more thought can be put into each word."
