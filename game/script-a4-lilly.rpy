    "To say such things so easily. What an unbelievable girl."

    hi "You're too kind-hearted, you know that?"

    "She takes a sip from her glass, the wine slipping down effortlessly."

    li "What of yourself? What's your family like?"

    hi "Well, I had friends and stuff. I guess it's not really any substitute, though."

    "After a second's silence, we both note the waiter delivering our meals."

    "Lilly does an expert job of appearing entirely normal, if not for the fact that her nod to him is slightly misaligned due to his silence."

    "At least it looks edible, I guess."

    "Lilly takes her knife in one hand and fork in the other, quickly getting to work on the dish as I do."

    "My haphazard, noisy shuffling of leaves and vaguely-meatlike squares onto my fork is matched by Lilly's silent and measured prodding and chewing."

    "The only giveaway as to her sight is the occasional tapping of the sides of a piece of meat to work out it's edges."

    "Another vestige of her academy days."

    "I find myself having finished my meager meal in little time, Lilly taking the last few bites as I sit observing her."

    "Her aura of confidence is something I've never really felt from any other."

    "She gives off an air of womanly grace. The word “girl” doesn't seem to fit her in any case."

    "In caring for Hanako, and indeed herself, she must have needed such a personality."

    "In order for everyone else to smile, she hid her sadness."

    "As she dabs her mouth with a napkin, I find myself shaking my head."

    "She doesn't need pity. Neither would she ever ask for it."

    li "Finished, Hisao?"

    hi "Yeah. Small, but it was pretty nice."

    "In a leafy, tasteless kind of way."

    "At least I know I'll never become a vegetarian."

    "Content with my appraisal, she gives a small nod."

    hi "You know, you're stunningly beautiful. I'm surprised no-one's ever confessed to you before."

    li "You assume they haven't."

    "The simple statement takes me off guard. Not that I should be surprised, I guess."

    hi "Really? Who was it?"

    "She gives a small, whimsical smile."

    li "He was from my class last year."

    li "A sweet boy, but a womanizer. It hardly took him a week to find another sweetheart."

    hi "Somehow, you making sure that he found someone else is hardly surprising."

    "She quickly moves to change the subject, a touch of embarrassment written on her face."

    li "And what of you, Hisao? I'm sure someone like you must have had at least one admirer."

    "As I open my mouth to speak, my throat seems to become slightly tight."

    hi "I… had… one. Her name was Iwanako."

    "I swallow down the ball in my throat, Lilly's face collapsing slightly as she hears the uneasiness in my voice."

    hi "It was when she confessed to me that I had my heart attack. There in the woods, during winter."

    li "I… see."

    "In the face of my unexpected wound, she finds herself lost for words."

    hi "She visited me when I was in hospital. For months she came in and talked, but eventually… she just stopped coming."

    hi "She was there every day. Then every second. Then once a week."

    hi "And finally, one day, she just stopped entirely."

    li "Did you ever see her again?"

    "I shake my head before realizing the futility of the task, wrapped in my own little world."

    hi "No. That was the last I saw of her."

    "Seconds pass in silence, before I speak again."

    hi "Come to think of it, I never did reply to her confession."

    hi "She just came of her own accord, and left just as she'd come."

    li "Did you love her?"

    "Did I love her… "

    extend "It's such a simple, obvious question, but I'd never asked it to myself."

    "Though I have a feeling that, no matter how much I pondered it, I'd never come to a conclusion."

    hi "I don't think so."

    hi "At the time I was just happy to have a girlfriend. I never felt any real attraction to her."

    li "But if you hadn't have had that happen to you…"

    hi "Well, in the end it did. There's no changing that. Besides, if I hadn't had my heart attack, I wouldn't be here."

    hi "Nearly dying gave me a second, totally different life. Ironic, isn't it?"

    "Instead of replying, she reaches forwards, taking my cheek in her palm as she smiles warmly."
