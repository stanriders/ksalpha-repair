    "After venting all that anger that I had bottled inside on Rin, it felt like a great weight had been lifted from my heart."

    "The tension that had grasped my mind for the past few weeks faded away without leaving even a shadow behind."

    "In this nearly zenbuddhist-like state of enlightenment I realized that perhaps it was a bad idea to yell at her like that."

    "I really meant it, but what good is blowing up like that? Nothing."

    "I am not like that. I don't normally yell at people. I don't know why yesterday I did."

    "So I keep feeling really guilty about it, and wanting to take my words back."

    "Rin is probably upset too. Even more than my own behaviour, her reaction shocked me."

    "I've always thought of her as unchanging, detached from her surroundings that seeing my yelling get her so upset felt… out of place."

    "I wonder if she understands how I feel?"

    "In Rin's world everything seems to be so absolute and subjective… absolutely subjective, as if she was completely unable to see things from other points of view than her own."

    "But ultimately, is anyone able to do it? Maybe objectivity and altruism are just illusions for people who like to think themselves as compassionate."

    "Just like art is an illusion for people who think reality is merely a veil for something greater."

    "Even when you stop thinking that the world revolves around you or start thinking outside of the mythical box, you are just inside another, bigger box that you can't escape."

    "Maybe that, ultimately, makes her alike the rest of us."

    "When you reach for the clouds, every inch counts."

    hi "Sure, let's watch the clouds. It's good to do something you really want to do, every now and then."

    rin "Yeah. You are probably right."

    "I glance upwards at the blue sky opening high above us."

    "It's perfectly cloudless."

    "It's a deep, cerulean blue vastness that spreads to fill my entire field of vision and beyond that."

    "Yet, Rin stays on her rock, peering to the distant horizon where the rainclouds are drifting further away from us."

    rin "I have decided something."

    "The dreaming voice of hers, spoken to the wind that carries it to my ears is lacking resolve in tone, but is full of it in meaning."

    rin "It's all right to be me after all."

    "The wind catches her hair and clothes, and Rin spreads her short arms into an embrace that is so very very tiny, but as wide as she can ever do."

    "For a moment it looks like she herself might take flight, and I have to hold myself back to not reach for her shoulder, to drag her back to me."

    "But this picture is something I can only watch, it is something for me to remember."

    "Rin's sleeves are flapping freely in the wind, her hair wildly tousled by it, her skin touched by the setting sun."

    "Her sleek form that I've come to adore, quivering in the cool wind that carries the small white specks past her, each a beginning of a new flower."

    "All that is engraved inside my heart."

    "Like those tiny seeds scattered into the wind, I'm sure Rin too can take her place in this world without the need to create her own inside of it."

    "Maybe she believes it too, and standing as close to heaven as possible, she is giving the world a big hug."

    "To me it seems like the entire world really could fit there, between those small arms of hers, inside of her all-encompassing embrace."
