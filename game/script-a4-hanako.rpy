    "Doctor" "People your age occasionally have some strange reactions to these medications, but we thought we had managed to get lucky in your case."

    "Doctor" "A lot of the time, it's simply nightmares, or a bit of insomnia."

    "Doctor" "But it seems that, in your case, it's much worse."

    "Doctor" "Unchecked, you could… well… you could lose your mind."

    "I see my father wrap his arm around my mother and pull her towards him."

    "“Ah” I think."

    "“That's where I get that from…”"

    "Doctor" "What I'm going to suggest may seem a little extreme, but, at the very least, it won't have these side effects."

    "Dad" "Anything… we'll try anything."

    "I want to pitch in my support, but great waves of fatigue crash down upon my mind."

    "As a sign of my consent, I simply wave my lips and nod my head."

    "The doctor correctly interprets my motions, takes a deep, mournful breath, and speaks."

    "Doctor" "I want to install a pacemaker."

    "Dad" "A pacemaker? Don't they only install them in geriatrics?"

    "Doctor" "Normally, yes. However, with your son's reaction to the standard medication, I think it's worth the risk."

    "Doctor" "I'll leave you to think about it, Hisao. But I'd like to show your parents some more information, if that's alright with you…"

    "Doctor" "There's very few pacemakers that are designed for people your age."

    "Doctor" "You've still got a bit of growth left in you, and a fairly long life to look forward to."

    "Doctor" "As a result, you would always have to be within reach of a well-equipped hospital."

    "Doctor" "Of course, you would have to have constant check ups, but I think that, eventually, you'll lead a fulfilling life."

    "Call me sceptical, but his repetition of “life” is worrying."

    hi "So, when do we do this then?"

    "The doctor grimaces."

    "Doctor" "Normally, I'd schedule the procedure immediately, but I'm concerned about the damage to your chest."

    "Doctor" "Ignoring the broken bones, there's a lot of damaged and inflamed tissue in your chest cavity."

    "Doctor" "I'm afraid that surgery, at this point, would only put you at further risk."

    "Doctor" "The procedure to install the pacemaker involves heavy chest reconstruction as is."

    "Doctor" "We can re-set your ribs then, but we need to wait for the swelling to go down at the very least."

    hi "I see…"

    "As if to confirm his diagnosis, I look down upon my chest for the first time since the incident."

    "He's right; I look like I volunteered to be a punching bag; dark, green-edged bruises mottle my skin."

    "The normal, smoothly-curved shape of my chest is jarred with swollen lumps and sunken areas where my ribs are still being set."

    hi "So… what happens now?"

    "Doctor" "We'll have to keep you here, under surveillance, until it's safe to operate."

    "Doctor" "After that, it'll probably be another week whilst we monitor the pacemaker's functions, then after that you'll be free to go."

    hi "And… how long will that be?"

    "Once again, the doctor's face falls."

    "Doctor" "That… could be some time. Possibly a month before we can operate."

    "Doctor" "Since we're still not sure which of your medications you reacted to, we'll use that time to run some tests."

    "Doctor" "In the meantime, I've let your school know that you're alright, and that you can accept visitors, if you wish."

    hi "Thanks."

    "I spy my parents, helpless and mourning, and for some reason, it makes me uncomfortable."

    "As much as I care for my family, I can't help myself but ask my next question."

    hi "What's wrong with Hanako?"

    "The doctor pauses for a moment, and my parents look at me quizzically."

    "I can see it in their faces; “Why is he asking about this girl?.”"

    "But I don't care what they think anymore. If I can't do anything for myself, then maybe I can do something for her."

    "Simply lying here, not knowing how she is doing, is worse than any other pain I've felt to date."

    "Doctor" "I'm not really the best person to speak to you about that, however I will send in someone shortly."

    "Dad" "Hanako… that's the girl that saved you, right?"

    "It would appear that they haven't been told the whole story, but that's alright."

    "Explaining everything would take far too long."

    "And I don't want to see how they react to me having a girlfriend just yet, either."

    hi "Yes, that's right."

    "Dad" "Well, then, the least we could do is pay her a visit for you."

    "Doctor" "I'm afraid that's not quite possible. Her doctor has forbidden anyone to see her, at least not for the moment."

    "Dad" "That's preposterous! We can't thank the person who saved our son?"

    "Doctor" "I'm afraid that's the case. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to leave now. I'll call you when I have more information."

    "The doctor walks out, and my parents take place by my bedside."

    "Mom" "Hisao… are you going to be alright?"

    "Doctor 2" "So, you know Hanako's accident happened at an early age."

    "Doctor 2" "In fact, she was still in her second year of elementary school."

    "Doctor 2" "Once she got out of the hospital, she returned to her old school, albeit under the care of a foster family."

    "Doctor 2" "Pardon? Oh, yes."

    "Doctor 2" "I've been caring for Hanako ever since then."

    "Doctor 2" "As I was saying, Hanako returned to her elementary school, and things seemed to be going fine."

    "Doctor 2" "For some reason, young children can be fairly accommodating, even with someone as scarred as her."

    "Doctor 2" "And, as I'm sure you've noticed, she's managed to conceal the worst of them."

    "Doctor 2" "For a time, she didn't show any of the usual symptoms of someone who had been through such a traumatic experience."

    "Doctor 2" "But, things changed when she entered middle school."

    "Doctor 2" "Teenagers aren't so forgiving, especially when struggling to find a new pecking order, like in a new school."

    "Doctor 2" "It wasn't long before Hanako was victimised and bullied into her shell, which is probably the Hanako you know."

    "Doctor 2" "But, she is strong. Incredibly so."

    "Doctor 2" "She managed to simply contain it within herself; and survive alone."

    "Doctor 2" "Of course, at this point, none of us realized anything was wrong."

    "Doctor 2" "She had survived elementary school unscathed, and never spoke of any of this in our sessions, so we assumed it was just smooth sailing."

    "Doctor 2" "But, near the end of middle school…"

    "Doctor 2" "… there was an incident."

    "Doctor 2" "We don't know if it was meant to be a prank, or if it were sincere, but a boy called Hanako out, to confess to her."

    "Doctor 2" "What actually happened, we don't know."

    "Doctor 2" "All we know is that, for some reason, Hanako ran away, and the boy chased her."

    "Doctor 2" "However, in the chase, the boy was hit by a car…"

    "Doctor 2" "…and killed, instantly."

    "Doctor 2" "Hanako saw the whole thing, and it sent her over the edge."

    "Doctor 2" "Nearly eight years of trauma, of bad memories, taunts, stares, isolation…"

    "Doctor 2" "Hanako cracked."

    "Doctor 2" "Like most mental disorders, it's hard to give her condition an exact name."

    "Dad" "That'll probably get worse as the painkillers wear off."

    "Dad" "I remember having my appendix out. I thought I was fine for the first half hour and then BAM."

    "Dad" "I could barely stand up."

    "Once again, I am reminded of how little I have in common with my parents now."

    #Or do you guys use scutches instead of stitches?

    "There's a little bruising where they must have moved my ribs around, but it's nothing compared to the damage that Hanako wrought on me."

    "Hanako."

    "Now that I'm better, it's only a matter of days before I'm allowed to see her."

    "Doctor" "And we've briefed the nurse at your school about looking out for you."

    "Doctor" "If you can promise to report to him twice daily for the first week I think we can let you go."
