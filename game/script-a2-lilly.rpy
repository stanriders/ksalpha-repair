    "Affectionately pawing Hanako's face with the backs of her fingers, her face looms barely inches above Hanako's face."

    "Hanako's amethyst eyes shy away to the side, unable to meet the gentle gaze of Lilly."

    "Her hair gently brushed aside, the cheek-born scars play their familiar melody across her face, an unseen rhapsody in red."

    "Nervously held to her chest, her arms tense slightly, her breasts filling out around the smooth backs of her hands."

    ha "L—Lilly… please…"

    "Taking the side of her face in the palm of her hand, her delicate pale lips brush those of Hanako."

    "Hanako's body relaxes, and for a fleeting second, Lilly's breath gently caresses her face."

    "As she pulls back, Hanako returns her gentle gaze."

    "What was a trickle of desire is now a raging torrent of passion, the atmosphere between the two changing perceptibly."

    "Hanako slowly raises her arms to hold Lilly's snow-white back, her fingers as touching the flawless skin of her pale shoulderblades."

    "Slowly withdrawing her lips from those of Hanako, Lilly slowly lowers herself to Hanako's full breasts."

    "The hands on Lilly's back helplessly slide off and onto the bed, the gaze of her companion transfixed upon her."

    li "My my, Hanako, such a beautiful body…"

    "A deep breath is the only answer to be given, and the only answer required."

    "She brings her mouth to the nipple of Hanako's right breast, her body tensing slightly as she does."

    "Sliding her mouth over, she closes her eyes as she savours the slight texture."

    "Hanako's breathing becomes deeper as she gently moves her lips left to right, the half-erect nipple giving slightly each way."

    "A slight shudder hails Lilly's tongue touching the tip, affectionately toying with it in her mouth."

    "Backwards and forwards, she gently moves her tongue over the delicate nub, wettening it as it grows ever-so-slightly."

    "She pulls back, sliding her hand back over the wettened breast and smoothly fondling it as she places a featherlike kiss between her soft, smooth breasts."

    li "Hanako, you're so beautiful…"

    ha "L… Lilly… Mmm… please, stop…"

    "Ignoring her objections, she moves her head down Hanako's body, sliding her hand down her side."

    "Affectionately pecking the smooth chest of Hanako as she goes, her last kiss is atop the whispy field between her legs."

    "As a pale hand makes its way around her pronounced curves, Hanako's breath catches as it passes her hip and stops at her thigh."

    "Shuffling backward, Lilly frees her other hand and gently feels down the left side just as smoothly as the right."

    "With the gentleness of a mother nursing a newborn, she rubs the outside of Hanako's legs."

    "A moment's pause, the labored breathing from above only heightening the excitement, before she moveds forward that last inch."

    "She delicately brings her tongue to the delicate nub in front of her, expertly finding it within the folds of skin."

    ha "Ah! Mmm… p—please… Mmmmn…"

    "Barely able to form a sentence, she surrenders herself to the trickle of pleasure from below, gripping the sheets ever tighter."

    ha "Mmm… Nnn… H—Hah…"

    "Lilly gently removes a hand from atop its resting place, cupping two fingers below her mouth."

    "She pushes them forward slowly, past the initial resistance of her wettened outside."

    ha "Ah, n—no! Please… ah… hah…"

    "As they move in, they give an unrefined, sloppy sound, contrasting to the barely audible licking of her tongue."

    "Once inside they easily move inwards, the warmth from the soft, wet skin almost welcoming them inside."

    "Hanako's delicate body moves slightly on the stained sheets in rythm with the gentle lapping over her most delicate area."

    "As she slowly moves her fingers outwards and inwards, Lilly's cheeks become even more flushed than before, all the more visible on her pale white skin."

    li "My my… Hana… chan…"

    "The excitement flowing into her breathless speech, she squirms her legs, the wetness of her thighs telling of her unbridled lust."

    ha "L—Lilly… Mmmmm… Nn…"

    ha "Ah, ah, Lilly… ah! Aaaah!"

    "She withdraws her tongue and stills her fingers for a second before unleashing an assault upon Hanako's senses, her tongue vibrating quickly."

    "To say he fits the look of his surroundings would be a good description."

    "I politely nod and turn to look around the store."

    "It's quite a bit larger than it looked from the outside, with three large shelves in the middle and wide tables around the outside."

    "Slowly walking and crouching down, I examine the table inside the shop window."

    "At least thirty small dolls, each about the size of an outstretched hand. There doesn't seem to be much variety in terms of make, all of them being ceramic and designed in the same way."

    "The only thing that separates them is their clothing, which spans all the colors of the rainbow and every time period from baroque to modern."

    "Even to my untrained eye, they're of exquisite quality."

    "Putting my tongue to me cheek in thought, I carefully take the price tag attached by a string to one of them to see the price."

    "I grimace."

    "Looks like these are out of the question."

    "Letting out a disappointed breath, I rest the tag on the table, stand, and turn behind me to survey the shelf."

    "Stuffed teddy-bears. Now there's a possibility."

    "I didn't see any in her room the last time I was in there, from memory, despite seeing a good number of porclain dolls, so I guess it's unlikely Hanako would give her one."

    "I look at them closely, occasionally giving them a light rub to see how they feel."

    "One in particular stands out, extremely soft to the touch and well-made."

    "Taking a hold of the tag, I note the name written in cursive English."

    "Steiff… I've heard of that somewhere."

    "As soon as I flip it over though, a familiar pang of disappointment rises again."

    "Damnit."

    "Is there anything in this cursed store I can actually afford?"

    "Though, I guess it's less the store's fault and more mine for having such a paltry budget."

    "Pocket money can only go so far, and my meds cost a rediculous amount to start with."

    "I walk around to the table at the far end of the store, this time covered by all manner of wooden clocks."

    "Furrowing my brow as I crouch, I closely examine one that catches my eye."

    "A miniature grandfather clock, complete with moving pendulum."

    "Inside the small glass bubble are the brass minute and hour hands, intricate designs engraved on both."

    "I can only stare at the workmanship that's gone into such a beautiful thing, and for a moment forget the reason I even came into the store."

    "As I look through them though, I notice a small box tucked away behind a toy car."

    "I instantly recognise the figure in front of me, frozen midway into kicking the green Vespa in front of her."

    "Her face has several streaks of oil on it, and the top half of her clothing's well and truly stained."

    yu "Ah…"

    "She collects herself and narrows her eyes as she stares."

    yu "I swear I've seen you before…"

    yu "Hmm? Ah, this thing."

    hi "Want some help? I'm no mechanic, but I guess another look wouldn't hurt."

    "No mechanic is putting it lightly. I know what each part does and where it goes… roughly."

    "Still, I can't just leave her stranded here without at least trying to help."

    yu "Well, you're welcome to look at it. I doubt it'll do much good though."

    "We both crouch down, with me carefully setting the bag in my hand aside whilst crouching to avoid my uniform getting stained."

    hi "Okay, let's have a look here."

    "First thing's first, there's a fan."

    "I guess that cools the engine."

    "I gently reach in and move it back and forward a bit with my finger."

    hi "Hmm…"

    "I return to trying my hardest to look like I know what I'm doing."

    yu "Yeah, it starts, sputters a bit and then dies."

    hi "Uh… huh."

    "I raise an eyebrow, reduced to merely watching this hopeless girl."

    "Ducking down, she expertly places the removed panel back in place as I stare worryingly at the fact she screws in the four corner screws with nothing but her fingers to tighten them."

    "Seemingly not noticing my apprehension, she grabs her red and white helmet from the far handle and slides it onto her head, leaving the straps to dangle uselessly beside her face."

    "A green Vespa, and a white helmet with a red stripe down the middle."

    "It's worrying that a blind person has better color coordination than she does."

    hi "Yeah?"

    yu "Thanks for the help."

    "…"

    "Still, I can't help but mull the idea over."
