    "I found out what happened through an email from Shizune on my cell phone. I didn't even notice it until almost 5 PM."

    "It's a bad habit I have, that I frequently forget to check or charge my phone, sometimes for days at a time."

    "So I didn't find out about the accident until almost six hours after it happened."

    "By the time I got to the hospital, it was too late."

    "“Shiina Mikado,” huh? It's kind of funny, that I didn't know your full name until then."

    "I'm a pretty lousy friend."

    "Afterwards, I was asked to answer some questions about Misha to the police. They were going to rule it as a suicide."

    "But that can't be right. The last day that I saw her, she looked so happy."

    "Unless that, too, was a lie."

    "I still refused to believe it. I told them that I refused to believe it. It's not denial, really. It's just that it I'm so sure they were wrong."

    "Despite…"

    "Misha, I was able to defend you at least this once. I hope I did a good job."

    "I'm sorry."

    "…"

    "There was a surprisingly small number of people at the funeral."

    "In the days after, I was able to rationalize it. Bit by bit. I had to."

    "It's the summer, after all. And Misha was pretty sociable, but she really didn't hang out with a lot of people. I think really only Shizune, myself, and Yuuko knew her all that well."

    "Even so, it's depressing."

    "I don't think her parents were there."

    "I haven't seen Shizune since that day."

    "A knock at the door takes me out of my reminescing. I'm grateful to whoever it is for that. Without thinking, I open the door. It's Hideaki. He has a bag on the floor next to him that he picks up when he sees me."

    hh "Good morning."

    hi "Yeah."

    "It's his usual greeting, but his tone is different. I can tell pretty clearly that this is a hollow formality. It's strange seeing him without the intense energy he usually has."

    "I'm grateful to him. He's the one who arranged everything for the funeral."

    hh "How are you holding up?"

    "It's a hard question. What am I supposed to say? How should I answer that? I don't think there is any way for me to respond to it correctly."

    hi "Fine."

    hh "I see."

    hh "How is Shizune?"

    hi "We haven't spoken in a while."

    hh "I see. Would you like to go see her now? That is why I'm here. I thought maybe she could use some cheering up."

    hh "I'm… not really good at that, though. If you could lend me a hand, I would appreciate it. I'm sure she would be happy to see you, too."

    hh "I'm also a little nervous about seeing her by myself. You being there will ease the tension a little. And, obviously, I need you to translate for me."

    hh "We can go whenever you're ready."

    hi "Do you think Shizune would be okay with having visitors? She looked pretty down the last time I saw her."

    "Actually, that would be an understatement."

    hi "So…"

    hh "You're right."

    hh "…"

    hh "Do you know why it was I who made arrangements for Mikado's funeral?"

    "He pauses. I don't know if he expects me to answer him or not."

    hh "It would make more sense if Shizune had done it. Obviously."

    hh "But, it seems like after everything that happened, Shizune has decided to stop doing anything, or even thinking."

    hh "It's weird."

    "I don't think Hideaki has ever seen Shizune like that before."

    hh "I want to cheer her up. Don't you?"

    "That is a pretty simplistic way to look at it. Things aren't that easy. It makes sense for him to be able to say that kind of thing, though. He is Shizune's brother, after all."

    "Shizune would always act like that too, like every obstacle in your way could be easily taken down so long as you tried hard enough. If you kept going constantly, you could overcome anything. I think that was the gist of what she believed."

    "I still can't believe it fully. This time, though, I'll go with it, like always. Just because I have always wanted to believe in something like that."

    hi "Let's go right now, then."

    "Outside it's like nothing has changed. The sun is shining pretty brightly in the sky. Any minute now, I expect Misha to grab me from behind and put her hands over my eyes."

    mi "Surprise~! Guess who~!"

    "…"

    "Heh. I've dealt with it so long that it's kind of become a habit of mine to be on my guard for it. I guess I can stop now, huh?"

    "My eyes are kinda starting to sting."

    hh "Are you alright?"

    "We have to stop for a little while because of me."

    "Hideaki knocks on the door to Shizune's room reflexively before trying the knob and finding it unlocked."

    "This is the first time I have been in Shizune's room. It's very plain and utilitarian, although I can see a personal touch here and there."

    "She still has the doll I won for her back then, on top of her desk."

    "When I get close enough for her to notice me, she looks up, and then quickly turns her head away."

    "She is sitting in her bed, back against the wall. There is a box of books beside her that she keeps held to her side."

    "The expression on her face is devoid of emotion, but I can see faint red tinges around her eyes."

    "It really is kind of unsettling seeing her like this."

    hh "Hisao, can you please translate what I say to her?"

    "I don't have the heart to tell him that she won't even look in my direction. I'll try, though. I'll keep moving in front of you if I have to, Shizune."

    hh "Hello, Shizune."

    hh "Are you doing okay?"

    shi "…"

    "Shizune's eyes seem to stare past us, instead of focusing on us. She nods as if to acknowledge our presence, but doesn't lift her hands to greet me at all."

    hi "Hi, Shizune."

    shi "…"

    "She doesn't move from where she is. In fact, the closer we go to her, the smaller she seems to get."

    hh "I have a present for you. It's a laptop computer. I made sure it was a slightly older model, since I know you like old fashioned things."

    hh "We can talk through this."

    shi "…"

    hh "Don't you want to talk to me?"

    "Shizune's hands remain limp at her sides even as Hideaki places the laptop in front of her."

    hh "Shizune, is there anything I can do for you at all?"

    shi "…"

    "Although I'm translating for Hideaki, I hope Shizune realizes that I consider myself to be speaking for the both of us. Unfortunately, it looks like she is actively trying to avoid looking at either of us."

    hh "I came all the way out here to see you. Please… do something. Can you at least look at me?"

    hh "Why won't you answer? I… sort of care."

    hh "…"

    hh "Fine, if you're going to be that way, then I understand completely. I'll be back some other time."

    "After Hideaki leaves, I try to get a response out of her. I at least try to get her to look at me."

    "I'm about as successful as he was."

    "What am I doing? There is nothing I can do right now."

    hi "I'll come back when you're feeling better, okay?"

    "As soon as I leave, I start to regret that I couldn't do something for her. I wasn't able to cheer her up at all. Really, I couldn't do anything at all."

    "The last few days, all I've done is sulk. The thought that wouldn't leave me alone for even a second was how Shizune had looked the other day."

    "I guess someone is trying to tell me that I can't just leave things like that. I wanted to do more. I could have done more. I should have been there for her, in some way."

    "I could have even given her a hug. Although maybe that would have been cheesy. I'm not some kind of hero."

    "I'm not good with these kinds of situations. I could really use your help right now, Misha. Of course, that's impossible."

    "Putting on my shoes, I head for Shizune's room again."

    "When I'm standing in front of the door, I freeze. I'm a little afraid. She might not look at me again, and if that happens, I don't know if anything I do will matter. Even if she does look at me, I'm not sure I can face her."

    "Her eyes were always so dark and piercing, filled with the spirit of her life. What will they look like now?"

    "The truth is, I've already been here three times since I first came to visit with Hideaki."

    "The first time, she wouldn't respond to me, no matter what I did. After that, both times, the door was locked."

    "Could it be locked even today?"

    "If you're going to just shut me out like that, Shizune, I don't think I could live with myself."

    hi "Hi, Shizune."

    shi "…"

    hi "Are you feeling better?"

    "I almost want to kick myself at how terrible that sounds. What a crappy thing to say."

    "You opened your door again. Didn't you tell me that you never did anything without a reason? Yeah, multiple times. Did you leave your door unlocked because you want someone to talk to?"

    "If that's the case, then answer me, at least once."

    hi "Shizune, please. I'll turn on the laptop. You can type whatever you want to say to me, but please say something."

    "I know that I probably got half of that wrong, but I'm sure she got the message."

    "I press the power switch on the computer and watch as it quietly hums to life in front of her."

    hi "Here you go. It'll just take a second. Can you just talk? A little?"

    hi "I'm worried about you. That's why I'm here. So, please talk to me."

    "At first, I am already about to give up. After all, I've been around her long enough to know that her will is stronger than I could probably dare to guess at. And that means if she doesn't want to talk, then it's all on her terms."

    "Just like always."

    "Then, surprisingly, she pulls the laptop closer to her and starts typing. After a few seconds, she erases what she has been writing and starts to sign."

    shi "Do you know what these are?"

    "Shizune takes out a book from the box at her side. She had this then, too. I take the book from her and look at it. It seems like an ordinary marble notebook, although it's been used quite a bit."

    "I flip through it. Every corner of it is filled with a large, childish handwriting and numerous doodles."

    ssh "I'm deaf. It's fun to mock a deaf person when they can't hear what you're saying. Even when they are standing right in front of you, they can't understand."

    ssh "It's really funny, isn't it?"

    "For just a second, she drops her guard. Even at a time like this, in such a state, Shizune never fully lowered the wall around her, but just now, I was able to see her past."

    "There's little I know about you. I underatand now, though."

    ssh "If she were here right now, I would tell her how much I loved her as a friend. I'm sorry."

    ssh "I'm really sorry."

    "Tears start forming in the corners of her eyes. She tries hard to hold them back, but I wonder if this time, she still has the strength."

    ssh "Do you hate me?"

    "Right now, I can't even process what just happened. I'm numb from shock. There was no way that I could have known, but thinking back, it all makes so much sense."

    "You were right, nothing you do is ever without reason. I get it now. That's how you're able to be so aggressive, launching yourself into the world as fearlessly as you do. And at the same time, you can be so cautious and patient."

    "I always wondered how a person could have that kind of duality."

    "And I'm also a little offended that you played with me in such a way."

    "I still love you, though."

    "But that is just shock. Even if right now, I feel like I can't breathe, it's just temporary…"

    ssh "You don't care that I lied?"

    "It's not that I don't care. It's just that there is no way to fully adjust to learning something like this. I would need more time. Time to sort it all out. Time I don't have right now, with her looking expectantly at me, trying to read my expression."

    "Were you just too deep in the lie that you thought you could never tell the truth?"

    "And are you that sick of yourself now that you can tell me?"

    "Do you want me to hate you?"

    "I hate it when I have to look so deeply into Shizune's every action. I'm not a mind reader, and sometimes, I think that she wants me to struggle to find out what she's thinking. It's always been that way, hasn't it? Just sometimes more than others."

    "But, at least you told me."

    hi "Hey, are you going to be honest with me from now on? I really like you, even despite all of this. Because of that, I don't like seeing you like this."

    hi "Weren't you supposed to be someone who would become a productive member of society? You said that, didn't you? If it's true, then stop acting like this. I'm pretty sure she wouldn't want you to dwell on this forever, too."

    hi "There was no way that you could have known all of this stuff. Now it's too late, but that's no excuse to… punish yourself like this. Is that what this is?"

    hi "If that is how you see it, then, yeah. I don't care if you lied to me."

    hi "Now, you can understand me, can't you? That's good. I can talk to you like I've always wanted to."

    hi "Okay?"

    "She doesn't look convinced."

    hi "The reason I learned sign language is because I wanted to talk to you. Now I can. And it wasn't a waste of my time. I still need it to understand you. And it'll look good on my college application."

    "I smile, hoping she'll return it."

    "I stand my ground, and she continues to walk into me."

    "She stops and presses her head against my chest, as if she's too tired to lift it again. For a second, I'm afraid she'll fall, but she grabs my shoulders and presses herself against me. Her tears are soaking into my shirt."

    "I hug her back."

    "This is the first time that you have ever leaned on me. That means that there is a pretty big responsibility on my shoulders now, doesn't it?"

    "It hurts that you lied to me. I'm not going to do anything stupid because of it, though. I'm… your support now, right?"

    "And you're also supporting me."

    hi "I just wanted to get my mind off things."

    yu "Oh."

    "From the look on her face, I think she knows what I want to get off my mind."

    "Yuuko was one of the few people who attended the funeral. If she wasn't, I think I would have trouble talking to her as freely as I'm doing right now. Kind of a weird thing to share a bond over…"

    yu "Sorry. I'm sorry. I just remembered that I have said a bunch of things to Shizune because I had to… get them off my chest, and I thought that she can't—um, couldn't—hear me, and I wouldn't have to be embarrassed."

    yu "Now, hearing this, I'm remembering it, and it's…"

    "Her face reddens, but she laughs again, partly out of nervousness, but she seems happy as well."

    yu "We should all go somewhere together some time."

    "She says, after a pause."

    hi "Yeah."

    yu "I am sure Shizune will be okay. If it isn't out of bounds for me to say that."

    yu "What you have just told me just means that you have her trust. Or else you would not know it."

    "Really? The way she looked, it hardly seems as if there was trust motivating her."

    hi "…For a while, I thought it would be good to just stop thinking about her, because I didn't want to deal with it. I'm a pretty shoddy friend, huh? Shizune would be right to say a person like that has no right to tell her how she should feel."

    #Yeah that's right a scene with absolutely no sprites or anything

    "I get a call from Hideaki at around nine in the morning. It seems like he's back to his usual self, as calm and formal as ever. Our conversation is brief."

    hi "Hello?"

    hh "Hello. Am I speaking with Hisao Nakai?"

    "Too formal. I'm pretty sure he's well aware that he is, and I feel the urge to be a little bit of a smartass."

    hi "Yes. Yes, you are. After all, this is my personal cell phone."

    hh "Am I calling too early?"

    hi "Not really."

    hh "I see. That is good. I'll be coming by in a couple of hours. Exactly two hours. Do you think that you could go with me to visit Shizune again?"

    hh "Our last conversation was not a conversation at all. I have been thinking since then about what I want to say to her, but I'll need your help again, of course. I'm sorry I have to keep bothering you with it. It's my fault for not learning sign language."

    "That's right, even Hideaki doesn't know Shizune can read lips… The level of commitment she put into hiding her ability is really something."

    "It's possible that the only person who knows is me."

    hi "Yeah, of course. Don't worry about it."

    hh "Thank you."

    hh "How is Shizune?"

    "A lot of ways to answer that question come to mind."

    hi "…She's fine."

    hh "Alright, then."

    "He hangs up the phone."

    "Two hours? I was actually planning on checking up on Shizune today myself, but now, I might as well wait."

    "It still feels weird, having to be so concerned for Shizune. After all, out of the three of us, she was always the one who seemed to actually have a plan for her life. Of course, unexpected things always happen."

    "She was the kind of person who would have taken those into account anyway."

    "I still don't know what I'm going to do with my life. Neither did Misha. I think I look up to Shizune, because of her assertiveness. Maybe I was always attracted to her and her precise, analytical way of looking at things."

    "But it seems like just as I want to change who I am, Shizune was trying to change who she was as well."

    "Now, with the way things are going, I wonder…"

    "I guess the question is: How easy is it for a person to change, when doing so requires you to change everything?"

    "And am I really accomplishing anything by sitting here thinking about this when there is so much more I should be doing?"

    "Especially now, at this important time."

    "I lose track of the passage of time in my thoughts, managing to forget the steady ticking of the clock on my wall. When I notice it again, I see that two hours have passed and then some."

    "I'm weighing the decision to call Hideaki back when the phone starts ringing in my hand."

    hi "Are you here yet?"

    hh "Actually, no."

    "His voice is mechanical and strained."

    hh "I went to see Shizune. She is… very sick. I'm at the hospital right now. I'm very sorry about not telling you this until now. I was panicked."

    "Hideaki is very good at keeping calm, but the news hits me with the feeling of a stone dropping into my stomach, and I wonder just how sick Shizune is that she would need to be hospitalized."

    "How was she taken there? If I had looked out my window at any time, it's possible I could have seen her and maybe done something. I don't even want to consider that possibility right now."

    "I'm already running before I realize that I don't know where the hospital in this town in. Or if there are even more than one."

    "The few people I can find to ask all have the same problem I do, and I only manage to walk around so much before I start feeling out of breath, and I start feeling a dull, stinging pain in my chest pulsing in sync with my heartbeat."

    "It's the final sign telling me to just stop. I don't have my cell phone, and I can see a pay phone, but I don't have any money to use it."

    "I feel like I could throw up."

    "…"

    "There is nothing for me to do but go back to school."

    #scene border removed

    "The hospital where Shizune is staying is almost identical to the one I was in less than a year ago."

    "If anything, it seems even bleaker. I guess hospitals tend to look more depressing when you're healthy and visiting someone who is sick than when you are sick yourself."

    "The room Shizune is staying in is painfully sparse, with nothing adorning the walls but a single overly colorful painting that looks out of place in the barren white room."

    "Shizune looks pale, but still manages to sit up straight when I enter the room, drawing the shirt of her school uniform like a cloak around slim shoulders barely covered by a hospital gown."

    shi "…"

    hi "Hello, Shizune. How are you feeling?"

    "I feel a little sick when I say it, and I'm glad she wasn't able to hear me, because it sounds so hollow that it makes my heart sink."

    "I watch a bead of IV fluid slide down the tube that vanishes behind Shizune, where it is connected to the arm behind her back."

    shi "…"

    "She raises her hands only inches off her bed, and then lowers them again with a second thought."

    hi "Is there something wrong?"

    "When she still doesn't reply, I take a seat in the small chair available to me."

    hi "You can understand me, even if I just talk… It's still kind of a surprise to me. I'm still getting used to it."

    hi "I don't know why you're here, but I guess it's serious. I know how you feel, how you felt about Misha dying. You're sick because of that, aren't you?"

    hi "Shizune, you have to stop dwelling on it. She was my friend, and I miss her so much. I keep expecting her to come out and surprise me like always. So, I guess I'm being presumptuous saying I know how you feel. I really can't."

    hi "…But… You have a future. You're still alive. Didn't you always make a point of showing me how much you could overcome? Your whole life is like that, because that is how you deal with literally everything."

    shi "…"

    hi "People who are left behind also have a duty. Do you understand?"

    shi "…"

    "She still doesn't raise her hands to reply to me. She hasn't signed a single thing to me since I got here."

    hi "Shizune, what are you thinking?"

    "Her eyes are as dark and piercing as ever, but so sad, like dulled jewels."

    hi "Please say something."

    "A feeling of deja-vu. Don't just shut down in front of me. I need more than that. I need you to tell me something, so that I can keep going. So that I know what I'm saying is working."

    "Even if it is false hope, throw me something. Do something more than staring at me."

    "I get up, and Shizune seems to misinterpret it as me wanting to leave. Her left hand rises and stretches out towards me, and I stop."

    hi "What is it?"

    "Her mouth opens slightly, as if to speak, but nothing comes out."

    "Just doing that seems to wear her out, and Shizune lies down again, her head sinking into her pillow."

    "What are you thinking? And why do you keep reaching out to me like that, preventing me from leaving, if you're not going to answer my questions, or tell me anything?."

    "A response, any one, will do. I just want her to say something. Every second that she doesn't, the more I start feeling like it was futile to come here. To have said anything."

    "Shizune is stubborn, even now. Maybe even moreso. If I accomplished anything at all, all it was as strengthening an already immovable will. Shizune, do you want me to live with that kind of guilt?"

    hi "Can I just ask what it is that you want to do? What's your intention?"

    "She shakes her head almost imperceptibly from side to side."

    hi "I…"

    hi "Is this really necessary?"

    shi "…"

    hi "Hey,"

    hi "Are you trying to follow Misha?"

    shi "…"

    hi "Is that really what you want?"

    hi "This is… the only time you have ever followed anyone. At least, that I've seen."

    hi "Please don't. Did you talk to Hideaki?"

    shi "…"

    hi "He's concerned about you. You can see it, can't you? And Yuuko, as well. And me. I didn't even want to think about it until now, the possibility that you want to kill yourself."

    "Shizune's eyes drop down to her lap at my words."

    hi "You're really going to…"

    "If anyone has the will to do something like that, it is her."

    hi "Shizune, do you understand what you are?"

    hi "You're supposed to be Misha's hope. You read her journals. She really loved you. A part of that was because you're so driven, and so intelligent. Now, you're just going to throw that away?"

    hi "She wrote that it's a big world, and it scared her, but she was able to keep going because she knew that the world had amazing people in it. You were one of those people to her. You're supposed to be an amazing person."

    hi "I'm sure that is who you are."

    hi "So this… is depressing."

    shi "…"

    "Can't you see that I just want you to get better? So just give me some kind of sign that my words are getting through."

    "Please."

    "She smiles very sadly."

    hi "I really love you."

    "I try to glean her feelings from the expression on her face, but it's impossible. A person who can hide their ability to lip read for over a decade. That is the kind of person I'm dealing with."

    "I had always thought that at times, I could see Shizune's true feelings behind that calm, oddly striking gaze. If I ever had that ability, it's left me now."

    "I plead with her some more, but it's futile. I try to dry my eyes with a napkin on the table beside me."

    "She continues to smile regretfully, with that horribly obvious fake cheer."

    hi "I don't want to just keep talking to you. Please just say something back."

    shi "…"

    "I'm not getting through to her, I guess."

    hi "I'll be back tomorrow."

    "As I walk towards the door, her left hand trembles and raises itself just a bit. She extends her pinkie finger."

    "A promise?"

    "Her hand reaches out to me once more, and then drops. A wave. I wave goodbye to her, too."

    "Later, I would find out that she died just a few hours after I left."

    "Afterwards, I would hear that she probably didn't raise her arms to communicate with me because she was too weak from dehydration to do even that."

    "But, I know that wasn't it."

    "The reason she didn't raise her arms to answer me was because if she had, even I could have seen the IV tucked into the crease of her elbow that she had pulled out from under her skin."

    "The reason she wouldn't let me come closer was likely because if I had, I would have noticed the spreading stain of IV fluid wetting the hospital mattress."

    "How can anyone living in a first world country die of dehydration? You would have to actively try to do it."

    "Which is exactly what she did…"

    "I didn't even find out until a full day after, because my cell phone had run out of battery power."

    "I was late even in receiving this news."

    "…"

    "I reacted like anyone else would."

    "“I'll be back tomorrow?”"

    "“I'll be back tomorrow?”"

    "Were these my last words to her?"

    "I'm so disgusted with myself."

    "She passed out of my life too quickly, but… I was powerless the whole time. And I was powerless after. Looking back, I see all the things I could have done, or could have done better."

    "So, what was stopping me all those times?"

    "I don't even have the will anymore to do a thing besides look back on the last few months and regret."

    "I knew them for less than a year. When I look back on it with that in mind, the time we spent together just seems even shorter."

    "I didn't even want to join the student council at first."

    "And I took it for granted. I even kind of hated it; Shizune with her ever confident and aggressively playful manner, and Misha's booming laughter and distinct way of speaking."

    "Both of them are gone now."

    "Misha, who was always so happy and smiled so brightly. She had wanted to become a sign language teacher. And Shizune, who always faced the world so aggressively and refused to be denied in everything she died."

    "Their lives could have went somewhere."

    "I hate myself the most because the last time I looked at Shizune, all I did was wave goodbye."

    "Her outstretched hand refuses to leave my memory."

    "Shizune, what did you mean by that? Were you just waving goodbye for the last time?"

    "What did you want from me?"

    "Was it that? Or… Did you expect me to grab your hand, and pull you up out of your sadness?"

    "That was probably it. I had made such a big show of wanting to save you, because I thought I could. I assumed that I could pull at your heart, like you did to me, and you would go back to your old self."

    "As if such a thing is so easy. If you couldn't do it, then what was I trying to accomplish with such a half-assed effort?"

    "You relied on me."

    "It was the first time you truly leaned on me."

    "And I failed."

    "Is this how you felt when that happened to Misha?"

    "I'll spend some time thinking about how to make it up to you."

    "These past few days, all I have done was think: “What more can I do?”"

    "It's only now that I dare to ask myself what I have actually done. The answer is nothing."

    "So after all I told myself I would do to do more for Shizune, I haven't actually done anything at all. I held her, but didn't say anything to lessen her worries. I observed her, but I didn't make any move to ease her troubles."

    "Even though I thought she might do something terrible."

    "Sitting here and waiting won't help. If I'm so worried about her, why did I even leave her alone in the first place? That was a mistake. It really was. But, I'm used to a different Shizune. One I never had to worry about."

    "Did I just want to keep believing in that Shizune? The Shizune that could do anything and would not allow herself to be stopped? I can still remember how she looked under the glow of the fireworks all those weeks ago."

    "That's probably when I started to fall in love with her."

    "Did I just think that that aspect of her personality would break through eventually and, while she wouldn't change back overnight, she would rebuild?"

    "I still think about Misha, so if that is really how it is, then I don't know what to think. It seems so wrong. Shizune and Misha were connected by something more than my tie to either of them."

    "That means that Shizune's wound is that much deeper. You can't even compare the two. Why did I put my hope into such a stupid and ridiculous thought?"

    "Then, I remember something Misha said to me a long time ago."

    mi "So… Please be a good replacement for me, Hicchan."

    "Damn it, stop turning away from me!"

    hi "Shizune, I'm finally able to understand how you think."

    hi "No matter what I say, if it's not good enough to really move you, you just won't even bother to respond. After all, you said that is the only benefit to sign language: That you can fully think out what you want to say before you say it."

    shi "…"

    "She smiles softly and nods her head up and down, wavering between happiness that I get it, and regret that it had to go this far before we could finally understand each other."

    hi "Even this. Even something like this."

    shi "…"

    hi "I'm not going to hate you, Shizune. You relied on me for something for the first time. How am I going to hate you when you rely on me?"

    hi "I thought that you would get that more than anyone."

    ssh "Everything is my fault."

    hi "It's not!"
