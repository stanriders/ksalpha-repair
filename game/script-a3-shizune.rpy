    "Last night, I confessed to Shizune. Somehow, these words continue to run through my mind, even a day after the fact."
    
    "I can still recall her expression: Just a little surprised, her dark eyes dropping to look at her hands as they wove around each other tentatively, searching for the right words, the right response."

    "In the end, she had settled on one word. One gesture. “Okay.” She looked so different there, unguarded and deep in thought."

    "After that, she had grabbed my hand, rubbing my fingers between hers as if she were feeling a piece of cloth to check the quality of it, and her hand had felt like silk as her fingertips brushed against mine."

    "Then, Shizune had taken a seat on the roof, pulling me down with that soft but firm touch just as the fireworks from town began to burst before us in the black night sky."

    "It was the second time I had sat on that roof, gazing at the fireworks with the air around me so still and cool that it's like I was in a bubble, far away from the rest of the world, with only Shizune beside me."

    "Neither of us made any move to communicate. There was nothing more that I could have said to her, anyway."

    "As I dwell on this memory of last night, another thought slowly forms in the back of my mind before materializing fully."

    "Misha had never come back last night."

    "It's because of her transparency that I know why. Misha really is Shizune's opposite… Shizune is always so analytical and cautious, so competitive and so reserved. Misha is nothing like that, she is much easier to read."

    "Yesterday, —no, these past few weeks, she was probably thinking about that moment, when I would confess to Shizune. What a friend, to care with such intensity about a friend's happiness."

    "My thoughts return to Shizune. She's my girlfriend now… I've never had a girlfriend before."

    "I've come close, but then…"

    "That's an unpleasant thought. An unpleasant memory. I push it away, feeling bad just for thinking it."

    "Shizune is my girlfriend now. Just a few months ago, I wouldn't have believed that I could fall in love with her. She was just the cute girl who bossed me around, and somehow roped me into joining the student council…"

    "I guess my problem is that I don't know where to go from here."

    "We both topple onto the bed, with me on top of her. I can't think anymore. This is the point of no return."

    "I run my hand up Misha's plump, silky thigh and hear a sharp intake of breath, but she doesn't tell me to stop."

    "As I feel my way up towards her groin, I feel a touch on my manhood that makes me shiver. But neither of us tells the other to stop."

    "And as I reach her most precious point…"

    mi "Aa… aahh…"

    "…I realize that Misha is way more decisive than me, and that we can't stop now. The leading edge of my hand stops at her panties, and I start pulling them off, feeling a soft, warm wetness behind them."

    "Without thinking, I press my fingers against her and hear Misha let out a small, restrained mewing sound."

    "She feels for my pants, seeming eager to return the favor, as unnecessary as it is, but it's hard for her to do so with me on top of her like this."

    "Misha's hands touch my hips and move across my chest. With my free hand, I start to feel her chest, amazed at the tenderness and shape of her breasts even through her clothes."

    "She looks as though she is about to say something, but stops herself and removes her shirt instead. I notice that her bra unhooks in the front and wonder if I should."

    "I undo her bra and brush it aside, massaging her chest with one hand. Misha's breathing becomes heavier and more pronounced. Our eyes meet, and a deep red color flushes across her cheeks."

    mi "Is it nice?"

    hi "Yeah."

    "This is wrong. For the first time, it hits me how wrong this is, but I can't seem to stop. Misha's face mirrors my own guilt."

    hi "Are you ready?"

    "Misha clasps her hands around me and nods. I slip her skirt off and look at her naked body. She has such a curvy figure for that cute face, and her skin is so pink and smooth."

    mi "This is my first time with a man. It's strange."

    hi "I'm putting it in now."

    mi "Please do it quickly…"

    mi "Ow…"

    "Misha tenses a little, but I'm beyond noticing. I flex, and I feel, and I grab. At some point, she raises her leg to wrap it around the back of mine, but I don't know if either of us is doing anything but going on automatic."

    "I notice her teeth are clenched to stop herself from making too much noise, but each time she has to take a breath, it slips out."

    mi "Haah~… haaah… haah~…."

    "Her arms wrap around my shoulders, her fingers curling and uncurling as they feel their way across my back as if searching for something."

    "Her actions only pull us closer together, and push me deeper inside her."

    "Finding a rhythm, I continue to drive myself into her, everything around me a haze except for her and myself, as if I'm intoxicated."

    mi "Hnn… Shicchan…"

    "I almost stop for a second, and immediately a bad taste fills my mouth as I'm pulled forcibly back to the reality of the situation."

    "I'm a pretty low person for this."

    "But where we are now, it's too late."

    "I keep on going, Misha's body pressed against my own, her breasts rubbing themselves on my chest. She pushes herself tighter against me, leaning into each thrust."

    "Her soft cooing in my ear makes me keep going, as does the hot, slick tightness around my member. Eventually, her leg twisting around mine, she tenses up in orgasm, her smooth neck rubbing across my cheek."

    "It takes a minute for her to separate herself from me, silently, her hair tickling my chest as she carefully rolls a few inches away."

    "There is no joy in what just happened. The more time passes, and the more the silence between us grows thicker, the dirtier I feel."

    "Her hand continues to grasp mine tightly. I wonder what she's thinking. Does she feel the same way I do? There is nothing in me now but a void, and the only things that form in the void are guilt, regret, and fear that I can't bear to look at."

    mi "I've done a really terrible thing, right, Hicchan?"

    "My weak fingers squeeze hers back."

    hi "No."

    "Inwardly, I yell at myself, because I can say so much more. I could… but I can't even begin to put it into words. And where would I start? And how could I dare?"

    mi "If Shicchan were to find out…"

    mi "I…"

    "A pause."

    mi "I've done another thing that can't be taken back."

    mi "All I do is hurt her."

    "Something inside me pushes me increasingly harder to say something."

    hi "It's fine."

    "My head hurts. My mind is white-hot with panic, but at the same time, I can think calmly. An unexplainable feeling, but I'm grateful for this opportunity, because I know the horrible place I'd be without it."

    hi "I love Shizune, too. I like her even more than I had thought. Now, I'm sure."

    hi "I just comforted you. And I learned something about myself, so don't feel bad."

    hi "I really love you both."

    "Misha seems to accept this. Her grip on my hand loosens, and she rolls a little further away. When she speaks again, her voice has regained some of its cheer. Of course, I have no idea if she's just putting on another happy face for me."

    mi "Thanks, Hicchan."

    mi "I'll go to sleep. When I wake up, I'll be a different person. A better person for you and Shicchan."

    mi "So, don't worry about me, okay?"

    hi "Okay."

    "I have always been really happy when the people around me are happy, too."

    "Because of that, lately I think more and more about what my life will be like when I will leave Yamaku."

    "It was really lucky for me that I was able to get into this school, and even luckier that I could meet Shicchan. If it wasn't for that, then I don't know if I would be here today."

    "I am who I am, so… I wouldn't, probably."

    "In just a few months, me, Shicchan, and Hicchan will all go our separate ways. It's like how a lot of flowers bloom on the same tree, but then when they fall, they never all fall together, do they?"

    "I'm right~! Haha…"

    "I only had a few friends in grade school, and in middle school, too. I remembered them for a long time after we stopped going to school together, but then they stopped talking to me. Their lives moved on, and I forgot them."

    "Shicchan… Is Shicchan going to forget me when she leaves this school?"

    "Will I have to forget Shicchan?"

    "I can't do that. Never. But, I know it will happen."

    "Hicchan said that just because we won't be going to school together, that doesn't mean that friendships have to end. If you fight hard enough for it, you can hold onto a friendship."

    "If I have to work so hard for it, though, then it's pointless. Of course I'll give it my 100\%! But it doesn't meant anything if Shicchan were to move on and stop being my friend. If she wouldn't try, then I don't think I could."

    "After all, then I would just be in Shicchan's way~."

    "If that happens, I don't know if I could go on."

    "It's likely that that will be what happens."

    "I only have ever loved Shicchan, even from the first day we met."

    "Shicchan once told me that she doesn't like Yamaku because it's where parents send the kids they are ashamed of."

    "It's true, Shicchan. I'm one of those children nobody wants. I have always been bullied, because I'm different. Isn't that something that I can't change? I'm really sorry. The things that are wrong with me, I can't change."

    "Not enough was wrong with me that I could get into Yamaku, so I had to make up a lie, that I wanted to be a sign language teacher. I don't like to lie, but the person I am now is a big liar, so…"

    "Shicchan, I wanted to talk to you, so I learned sign language, even though I wasn't very good at it, and I'm forgetful."

    "You told me that a human being doesn't need a meaning, or a purpose, or respect; those can all be gained if you work hard enough."

    "I'll really become one; a sign language teacher. If I'm something, then I'll be a real person to you, right, Shicchan?"

    "The only person I have really had is Shicchan."

    "Shicchan, I really, really love you."

    "I wish I could just interpret for you forever."

    "I know it's unrealistic, though. You would hate me eventually, because I wouldn't be a person moving forward in life."

    "If Shicchan were to hate me, I would probably die."

    "Haha~. If Shicchan and I keep going, then we'll drift apart. But the same thing might happen if we stay together."

    "I guess I'm just not the right person for you, Shicchan."

    "So~… I've been thinking about “that” for a long time…"

    "Maybe it's better if I didn't exist."

    "…"

    "I talked with Hicchan the other day. It's hard for me to understand Hicchan, but he seems like a good person. I feel a lot better now, because I was able to tell someone how I feel."

    "The things I want to tell Shicchan would be silly to her, and I don't know if I could sign all of that to her. And~! Shicchan has her own life."

    "Shicchan and Hicchan are a real couple now. I'm so glad. I was able to see them both fall in love."
