    "The noise of the festival wafts through the trees, louder than before."

    "I guess that most of the crowds come here in the afternoon."
    "For a moment, I stand still; the only thing I planned to do today was watch Lilly play."

    "With that goal now complete, I am at a loss as to what to do."

    "It takes me less than five minutes to find myself a noodle stall, owned and operated by the hard-working souls of some second-year class."

    "Within a moment, I am the proud owner of a plate of undercooked noodles."

    "While stuffing my face, I see Shizune wavering within the crowd."

    hi "Fizube! Mmifa!"

    "Of course, Shizune's pace doesn't falter, but Misha looks up."

    "I guess her interpretation skills also include “full mouth.”"

    "She pauses for a moment, before pulling the cheek below her left eye down and sticking her tongue out."

    "In an instant, she rejoins her partner and they're lost in the crowd once again."

    "Behind her, adorned in light purple flannel and kneeling beside a low table, is Hanako."

    "Her hands are firmly fixed between her legs, her shoulders forward, and her head down, as if trying to hide herself in her pajamas."

    "Not that that would be too hard; they look to be a good two sizes too large for her."

    "Folds of flannel flow from her frame, making her look like a child playing dress-up in her parents' clothes."

    "She looks up to confirm my identity, and a thin smile creeps across her face."

    "I steal a glance to the side to take note of Lilly."

    "Her pajamas are dark and breezy, and obviously of quality make. Silk, at a guess."

    "Underneath her short-sleeved top is a pair of silken shorts…"

    "Her voice brings me out of my fascinated examination of her legs."

    "I'm blushing. I've obviously let her know something's out of place. Even Hanako's noticed my staring…"

    "…But I can't say I regret it. Not in the least."

    hi "Ah, n—nothing. You're both a welcome sight, believe me."

    "I am the luckiest man alive."

    li "Well now, there's no point in you standing in the doorway. Please, take a seat."

    "I take a step into the room, and Lilly closes the door behind me."

    "As she turns back toward the room, she bumps into me and grasps my arm."

    li "My my, I'm afraid that this is a small room with the three of us."

    "She says that as if it's a bad thing."

    li "Would you mind helping me take a seat?"

    "Slightly dumbfounded, I guide Lilly to the table, where I see a small tea set resting."

    li "Well now, how about some tea. Hanako, could I impose upon you as to pour?"

    ha "S…sure. His…sao… Would…"

    ha "…would you…"

    ha "N… no. It's just… just…"

    hi "It's just been a tiring day?"

    ha "Y… yeah."

    "Despite my current understanding of Hanako, she continues to smile her thin smile as she pours the tea."

    "I take up my position at the table, with my back to the door."

    "To my left is the darkly-clad Lilly and to my right sits the violet Hanako."

    "The tea set on the table looks exquisite; as if pure beauty had been frozen in bone-white china."

    "A highly appropriate set for someone as refined as Lilly."

    "There is a slight “tink” as Hanako accidentally clips the teapot on a cup as she is pouring focuses my attention on her."

    "She breathes in sharply; I guess the set is as delicate as it is beautiful."

    "A fitting metaphor for the pair of girls that grace my presence."

    "Hanako quivers at her mistake before Lilly gently rests a hand on her wrist."

    li "Hanako, are you okay?"

    # Some lines snipped - Suriko

    "Hanako glances to Lilly's face, a look of slight worry upon it."

    "I guess Hanako isn't usually this skittish, though I can well understand why."
    
    "I'm nervous as all hell, and I'm not even the one trying to hide myself from someone."

    "However, Hanako seems to find some confidence in Lilly's words and deftly pours the next two cups."

    ha "Here you go, Hisao… Lilly."

    "Hanako gently places a cup and saucer in front of me, and then another in front of Lilly. I could get used to service like this."

    li "Thank you, Hanako."

    hi "Yeah, uh, thanks Hanako."

    ha "You're both welcome."

    # > Nevertheless, went with an edited version of it. Commented out the last line, though; it drives home an already obvious point. --Kagami

    "Lilly raises her voice ever so slightly to be heard above the din."

    li "So, Hisao, what did you think of the festival?"

    hi "Well… It was a lot busier than I expected. I'm used to school festivals where nobody but the students and their parents show up."

    ha "That's because it's one of the big festivals in town."

    ha "Mostly because of the fireworks."

    hi "Well, I think it's good to see everyone working so hard to put on a good show."

    hi "Back at my old school, we all just put on crappy cafes."

    li "What a shame. There's a certain joy in putting a lot of effort into your work."

    # > I'm suddenly wondering if the way I reworded this takes away from Lilly's intent to hook them up.  --Kagami
    
    "Lilly quietly answers her phone, and, feeling her way around me, makes her way into the hall."
    
    "Hanako and I sit in the newly formed silence, nursing our teacups."
    
    hi "So, do you really watch the crowds?"
    
    "Hanako almost chokes on her tea, but saves herself."

    li "My apologies, duty called."
    
    hi "Oh, was that something related to the school?"
    
    li "No, I fear it was my cello tutor."
    
    li "She had to cancel my next lesson."
    
    "Part of me is surprised that Lilly takes lessons."
    
    "But then again, even pro athletes have a coach. I guess there's always something you can learn."
    
    li "However, I do now have next weekend free."
    
    li "Hisao, would you perhaps like to accompany Hanako and I?"
    
    li "It could be a good chance to become familiar with the town."

    li "Well then, it's settled."
    
    li "Hanako and I will prepare some snacks, so you shouldn't need to worry about food."
    
    hi "Awesome. I'm liking the sound of this more and more…"

    "As with her uniform, the dress looks to be a few sizes too large for her, covering her entirely."

    "She holds a small picnic basket in front of her with both hands, forming a barrier between herself and the outside world."

    hi "Who are?"

    "Hanako doesn't answer, but simply nods her head forwards."

    "On the footpath ahead, I see a man and woman walking towards us, talking to each other."

    "As I watch them, they notice the three of us."

    "They look for a couple of seconds, but as soon as they see Lilly waving her cane, they seem to divert their eyes from us."

    "Suddenly, I realize Hanako's point."

    "Even without our uniforms, it's pretty obvious that we're from Yamaku."

    "Apart from the school, there are very few houses in this end of the town, and Lilly's cane is a dead giveaway."

    "By deliberately avoiding eye contact, the couple are paying just as much attention to us as if they were staring directly at us."

    "I guess that Hanako has experienced this effect a lot."

    "Even with the most careful grooming and the loosest-fitting clothes, you can still see some of the grafts on her hands and face."

    "It's a patch of grass nestled between an intersection."

    "We move towards the shade from the trees, and I take the picnic basket from Hanako."

    hi "Here, let me set this up for you."

    "She is initially reluctant to give me the basket, but releases it nonetheless."

    "Immediately she runs to Lilly's side. She's probably still rattled by the incident before."

    hi "Would you two like to sit whilst I get this ready?"

    li "Please. The walk was a little longer than I remembered."

    "Hanako nods, and guides Lilly to the blanket."

    "After making sure that Lilly is alright, Hanako sits between the two of us."

    ha "H…here. Let me help…"

    "Hanako dives into the basket and starts pulling out tiny wrapped packages, which she then arranges in front of us."

    li "Ah, of course. Hanako, could you please get that?"

    hi "I guess one each then, eh?"
