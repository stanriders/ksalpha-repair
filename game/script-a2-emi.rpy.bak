    "Still, I don't think my question's been answered."

    hi "Even if you do have a few hobbies, I still don't see why you hang out with Rin so much."

    hi "I mean, she's kind of weird, isn't she?"

    "This comment causes Emi to laugh loudly."

    emi "Ha! That's an understatement, I think."

    hi "So why? I mean, you're a lot better at conversation and stuff, so I figure you'd hang out with a lot of people, but I think I've only ever seen you with Rin."
    
    "Emi seems unusually defensive."

    emi "Hey, I hang out with plenty of people that aren't Rin! You just don't see me doing it because I'm not in your classes."

    hi "Okay, but that still doesn't explain why you hang out with Rin."

    "I'm not even sure why I want to know this."

    emi "She says we both chase after an extreme."

    emi "Like, she's always trying to find a new way to show a particular feeling or something."

    emi "And I run because of the feeling I get from it."

    "She seems completely absorbed in the race."
    
    "Emi's mother cheers again, and I assume that the race is over."

    "She directs my attention toward the track again, where the 100m is about to start."
    
    "I watch Emi closely."
    
    "As she gets into the starter's blocks, her whole body seems to relax, but it's a false relaxation."
    
    "I can see that she's actually like a coiled spring."
    
    "As the starter tells everyone to get set, her head snaps up, and her eyes narrow slightly."
    
    "Her mouth curls upward in what could be a grin and could be a growl."
    
    "When the pistol goes off, it's as if she's been unleashed from a cage, like she was always moving at her blinding speed but we couldn't see until the starter's pistol dispelled the illusion of her motionlessness."
    
    "It's all over in a few seconds, but in those few seconds I feel like I just witnessed something very personal for Emi."
    
    "As soon as she crossed the finish line, the fierce look was replaced by her normal grin."
    
    "The conquering general returning to his farm."

    hi "Yeah, she told me."
    
    "I'm uncertain as to whether or not it would be rude of me to ask after Emi's father."

    hi "Hmm?"
    
    emm "They were very close."
    
    hi "I see."

    "The race begins, and I cheer Emi's teammates along as they pass the baton."
    
    "Finally, I see Emi sprinting on to the track to take the final handoff."
    
    "Once again I'm taken aback by how graceful she looks when she runs."
    
    "It really is beautiful."
    
    "And with that look of determination and fearlessness on her face, it only adds to the picture."
    
    "Emi at her Emiest, I suppose."
    
    "But then, as she crosses the finish line, I see her stumble slightly."
    
    "It's only slightly, but it's a definite stumble."
    
    "Rin inhales sharply, and actually looks concerned for a second."
    
    rin "Aw, Emi…"

    rin "It must be bad."

    "Rin seems to be waiting for Emi to notice that she's arrived."
    
    "Oh yeah, I guess she can't exactly wave Emi over."
    
    "Then again, I'm not sure that Rin would do such a thing even if she had arms."
    
    "It doesn't seem her style to draw attention to herself."

    "Why do I feel like I'm making excuses to the nurse?"
    
    "Moreover, why do I feel a need to justify continuing to run despite the pain?"

    "Rin, maybe. But Emi's far too energetic."

    "Emi gives a half-smile at my response, and then just like that she's back to her old self."

    emi "Well, prepare yourself for tomorrow morning Hisao!"

    emi "We'll have to go twice as hard to make up for today!"

    emi "…Thanks."

    emi "For dropping by, I mean."

    emi "You're kind of the first visitor I've ever had who wasn't Rin."

    "Now that's surprising."

    "She's really pushing herself today."

    "By the time I'm done with my lap, she's laying across one of the bleachers, looking exhausted."

    "Being sick had nothing to do with it."

    "Something's bothering her."

    "Maybe the nightmare. Maybe something else."

    emi "You have no idea."

    "The sincerity in her voice confirms my suspicion."

    "The only problem is…"

    "Even though I know she'd tell me if she wanted me to know, I still want to know."

    hi "Something on your mind, then?"

    "Emi doesn't seem surprised by my question."

    "Instead, she shrugs."

    emi "Nah, it's nothing worth getting worried about."
    
    "She seems as if she's trying to convince herself as much as she's convincing me."
    
    "I open my mouth to ask if yesterday is responsible for her current state of mind, but think better of it."

    "Too much risk of her taking the question the wrong way."

    "Besides, I'm not even sure myself what to think about yesterday."

    "Really I can only get about as far as how it felt to have Emi sleeping next to me before my brain shuts down."

    "Having her before me now, covered in sweat and looking wryly at me, she's making it difficult to think."

    "Emi giggles and starts to look a little like her old self, but there's a new element to her expression."

    "Impish. That's how I'd describe it."

    "Emi looks impish, looking up at me with her head nestled into my shoulder."

    emi "Would you come with me if I ran off to be a pirate?"
    #Modern pirates are lame though…
    
    hi "Of course I would!"

    hi "Who in their right mind would pass up the opportunity to be pirates with you?"

    emi "Well, when you put it that way, I'm not sure."

    "She giggles again."

    "I notice that my heart seems to have sped up."

    "It's probably due to Emi's proximity to me."

    "The hint of strawberries again."

    "I can't help but grin as I gaze down at her."

    "She's happy again."

    emi "Hey, Hisao."

    hi "Hmm?"

    emi "If you're going to kiss me, you should probably do it soon."

    emi "I think the lunch bell is about to ring."

    "My thoughts grind to a sudden halt."

    "I'm pretty sure my mouth is hanging open in shock."

    "All I can manage is a strangled “Huh?”"

    "This amuses Emi even more."

    emi "You were thinking about it, weren't you?"

    "She sits up, bringing her face level with mine."

    emi "I'd probably enjoy it, you know?"

    emi "You're a really…"

    emi "…Well."

    "She briefly composes herself, looking like she's about to say something important."

    emi "If you hadn't figured it out by now, I think I've developed a bit of a crush on you."
    
    emi "You're going to have to do something about that."

    "This time her grin short circuits several important thought processes."

    "At some point I turned toward her, and at another point her arms moved to around my neck."

    "At yet another, my arms wrapped around her waist."

    "I'll be damned if I could tell you precisely when that happened."

    "Because at the moment, there's only a voice in the back of my head yelling at me to kiss her."

    "I look into Emi's eyes."

    "There it is."

    "The thing I saw yesterday on the bed."

    "It's there again."

    "It suddenly strikes me that she's worried that I'll reject her."

    "What a silly worry for her to have."

    "Her lips taste faintly of strawberries."

    "She leans into the kiss, and her arms tighten around the back of my head, making sure that I don't pull away."

    "Not that there was any danger of that."

    "There's a churning feeling in my gut."

    "The world falls away."

    "There's just me, and her, and this bench."

    "My arms tighten, drawing her waist closer, entranced by the feel of her."
    
    "I inhale the scent of her, my mind trying desperately to memorize everything about how she tastes, how she smells, how she feels."

    "The ringing of the bell snaps us both back to reality, and we break the kiss."

    "Emi's cheeks are slightly flushed, and she seems to be catching her breath."

    "In her defense, so am I."

    "We stand there for a few moments, trying to wrap our heads around what we've just done."

    "Emi is the first to break the silence."

    emi "So…"

    emi "… Wanna grab dinner after I'm done with practice?"

    hi "What a coincidence."

    hi "I was about to ask you the same thing."
    
    "Well, actually I suppose it was going to be some kind of proper date on the weekend or something."
    
    "But the thought was there, I think."

    "Emi gives me a playful shove."

    emi "Yeah right."

    emi "You were still in shock from how incredibly awesome I am at kissing."

    "We begin to head down the stairs back to our respective classrooms."

    hi "Hey, I didn't see you talking immediately afterwards either."

    "Emi grins."

    emi "That I didn't."

    emi "See you after practice, Hisao."

    "She leans in quickly and gives me a quick kiss in the middle of the hallway, sending me into another brief state of mental freefall."
    
    "As I head into my classroom, a giggling Misha greets me."
    
    mi "Why Hicchan, you romantic, you~!"
    
    mi "Did you confess on the rooftop?  Did you~?"
    
    hi "Er, actually I think it was the other way around."

    mi "She's a good kisser, isn't she Hicchan~?"
    
    hi "Er…"
    
    "Before I can respond, Muto's entered the room and Misha skips off to her seat, giggling all the while."
    
    "I suspect that I'll get a lot of that sort of conversation now."
    
    "Especially seeing as how Emi kissed me right in the middle of the hall."
    
    "But somehow, I don't care about that."
