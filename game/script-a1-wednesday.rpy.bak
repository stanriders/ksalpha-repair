"I feel very tired this morning, probably because yesterday itself was a very tiring day. On top of that, I woke up far earlier than necessary."

"After saying hi to Shizune and Misha, I start doing the work as instructed from the board. It already looks like today is going to be heavy."
#...heavy? ----K.

"I don't have a problem with that now, though. Shizune and Misha might jump on me trying to get an answer about whether or not I've decided to join the student council, even if it's just one day."

"I wouldn't put it past them to try, and I don't have an answer for them if they do. So, this situation is convenient for me."

"About ten minutes into class, Hanako walks in and takes a seat, but no one looks at her. The teacher doesn't even comment on her lateness."

"He does, however, stop us to say that we're going to break into groups again."

"I almost want to say something about how her rush to get started seems a bit much, considering the small amount of work, but Shizune probably knew how little there is and simply doesn't care."

"Yeah, it seems like the workload doesn't matter to her as much as the fact that there is work; the actual amount is unimportant. She approaches everything with the same level of ambition."
