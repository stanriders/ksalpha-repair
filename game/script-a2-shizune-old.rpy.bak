    "Then again, Shizune and Misha have a different definition from mine when it comes to what constitutes a lot of work."

    "It seems like I have some conflicting feelings about the student council. I enjoy spending time with Shizune and Misha, but no matter how you look at it, work is work."

    "Learning sign language is kind of nice, though."

    "They are definitely more engaging than my other teachers, and if I can learn it, I won't feel as left out as I do sometimes when Misha forgets to translate for me as well."

    "I'll also be able to talk to Shizune without having to go through Misha, although I'm sure Misha doesn't really mind filling in that role."

    "Looking back on it, though, there never was that much work to be done, and both of the girls always did more than their fair share."

    "And Misha had said that they hadn't asked me to help them out because they thought I needed to rest."

    "It depresses me that they know there's a problem and that I consequently have to acknowledge it, but I'm cheered up by their consideration."

    "With that in mind, I resolve to stick with my student council duties. I'll give it my all, for at least tomorrow. Then I'll go back to trying to get out of it."

    "There is no dodging the fact that they likely know that I'm not all well."

    "Maybe I'm just overthinking things."

    "I shift my thoughts towards what Shizune had said: That sign language is useful because more thought can be put into each word."

    "Is that how Shizune thinks? I wonder what it must be like, thinking so hard about the impact of your every word."
